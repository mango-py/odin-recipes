    <h1>Authentic Saag Paneer</h1>
    <h1>Description</h1>
    <h2>Saag paneer is a classic Indian dish of cooked spinach studded with cubes of fried paneer cheese. Thickened with cream or coconut milk, it's a hearty and filling vegetarian meal.</h2>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>2 bunches spinach, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 bunch fenugreek leaves, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons canola oil, divided</li>
        <li>Â½ pound paneer, cubed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds/li>
        <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 tomato, diced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoons ground masala</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until crumbly, browned, and no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook the bacon in the same Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain, leaving a few tablespoons of drippings with the bacon in the bottom of the Dutch oven. Stir in the onions and garlic; cook until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour the chicken broth into the Dutch oven with the bacon and onion mixture; bring to a boil over high heat. Add the potatoes, and boil until fork tender, about 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and stir in the heavy cream and the cooked sausage; heat through. Mix the spinach into the soup just before serving.</li>
    </ol>
