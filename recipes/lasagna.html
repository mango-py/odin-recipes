    <h1>Description</h1>
    <h2>This is an oh-so-good recipe. Just the right amount of spice to make you take a cold drink but definitely keep coming back for more! This soup is irresistible!</h2>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound bulk milk italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 1/4 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>5 (13.75 ounce)  cans chicken broth</li>
        <li>6 potatoes, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/4 bunch fresh spinach, tough stems removed</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until crumbly, browned, and no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook the bacon in the same Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain, leaving a few tablespoons of drippings with the bacon in the bottom of the Dutch oven. Stir in the onions and garlic; cook until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour the chicken broth into the Dutch oven with the bacon and onion mixture; bring to a boil over high heat. Add the potatoes, and boil until fork tender, about 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and stir in the heavy cream and the cooked sausage; heat through. Mix the spinach into the soup just before serving.</li>
        
    </ol>
